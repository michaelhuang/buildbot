from tomprince:
* use inlineCallbacks rather than deferredGenerator
* name MQConnector classes only in mq/connector.py
* move re's in simple.py to module/class scope
* s/consume/addConsumer/ (or "startConsuming"?)
* s/stop_consuming/stopConsuming/g, generally do Twisted style
* don't verify mq keys in config.py
* message contents are XXdicts, maybe plus useful stuff

* bug/TODO: failing to claim a merged set != all requests claimed elsewhere ->
  retry? or does this fix it:

* backup buildreq poller -> un-delete the poll interval config

tasks
* add builders to objects, use that as builderid
* finish messages
* POC web frontend
* metrics for number of outstanding QueueRef instances, as well as msg/sec, etc.
* add periodic check-ins for builders (maint)
* add periodic check-ins for schedulers (maint)
* add periodic missed-buildrequest scanning in botmaster

on master
* standardize buildsetid => bsid in db connector too
* "maint" framework a la cron
* "monitoring" framework with alerts -> nagios, email, etc. (replace/adopt PollerWatcher)

problems
* test_load_mq_explicit_type should use something other than 'simple', when
  another option exists
* queue schema docs are not entirely accurate
