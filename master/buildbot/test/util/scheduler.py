    This class fakes out enough of a master and the various relevant database
    connectors to test schedulers.  All of the database methods have identical
    signatures to the real database connectors, but for ease of testing always
    return an already-fired Deferred, meaning that there is no need to wait for
    events to complete.

    This class is tightly coupled with the various L{buildbot.test.fake.fakedb}
    module.  All instance variables are only available after C{attachScheduler}
    has been called.
